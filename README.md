 This project showcases a fully responsive UI for a restaurant  
website, utilizing HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to craft a modern and professional 
design. The website includes several key features: a top navigation bar with 
centered links , a dynamic image  at the header, and 
dedicated sections for "About us" and "Menu" which include descriptive text 
and related  content. The layout is designed to be visually appealing 
and user-friendly across various devices, ensuring a seamless viewing experience. 
This project serves as an excellent practice for students to understand and 
implement responsive web design techniques, Bootstrap components, and the 
integration of Map elements in a webpage.
